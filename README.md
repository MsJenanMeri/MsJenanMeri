<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Jenan! As a data analyst, I enjoy leveraging my strengths in analytics and communication to solve problems, uncover insights, and help others. 
I have the most fun on projects when the results can be used to make a change or impact. For example, I downloaded and analyzed Tiktok data to identify trending songs and determine which aspects of a song contribute to its popularity. This allows me to select the best music for my data analytics content on the platform, where I help others learn all aspects of data analytics (including SQL and data visualization). 
Check out my extensive portfolio for samples of my work in SQL and Python.</p>
